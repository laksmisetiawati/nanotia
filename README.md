You only need to show two pages: \
* Front Page \
    ○ Shows a list of posts with title and a snippet of the post content. \
    ○ Example: https://www.techinasia.com/ \
    ○ API Endpoint: https://www.techinasia.com/wp-json/techinasia/2.0/posts \
* Single Post Page \
    ○ Upon clicking on the post title on the front page, it will bring you to the single post
    page. \
    ○ The Single Post Page should be paywalled on the frontend. \
    ○ The visitor is allowed to view only 5 articles within the month. \
    ○ If the user hits the limit, a portion of the content should be blank out in the Single
    Post Page. \
    ○ Example: \
    https://www.techinasia.com/google-temasek-digital-economy-report-2018 \
    ○ API Endpoint: \
    https://www.techinasia.com/wp-json/techinasia/2.0/posts/google-temasek-digitaleconomy-report-2018 \
    You don’t need to design any layout or elements, you can use the default Bootstrap theme.
